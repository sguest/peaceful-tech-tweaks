# Peaceful Tweaks for Bob's Equipment

This mod removes the military science cost and Military 4 pre-requisite from the radar, power armor, and fusion reactor technologies in [Bob's Warfare](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobwarfare) and [Bob's Personal Equipment mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobequipment).

This is intended for use on a biter-less playthough. On such a map you may still want to use the upgraded power armor, radar, and fusion reactor options. However, without biters to shoot at these are likely the only things you'll use military science for, making it a waste to set up an entire military science production chain just for these couple researches.

Technically both Bob's Warfare and Bob's Personal Equpiment are optional, and running this without either of the above will just affect the vanilla power armor and fusion reactor techs.

Inspired by the [RemoveMilitary mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RemoveMilitary), which does effectively the same thing but for vanilla techs only.
