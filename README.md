This mod removes the military science cost pre-requisite reseraches the power armor, fusion reactor, and spidertron technologies.

 in [Bob's Warfare](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobwarfare) and [Bob's Personal Equipment mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobequipment).

This is intended for use on a biter-less playthough. On such a map you may still want to use these technologies for construction and logistics purposes. However, without biters to shoot at these are likely the only things you'll use military science for, making it a waste to set up an entire military science production chain just for these couple researches.

Supports both [Bob's Warfare](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobwarfare) and [Bob's Personal Equipment mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobequipment) as optional dependencies. If they are installed, it also updates the higher-level power armor techs, different spidertron techs, and advanced radars.

Inspired by the [RemoveMilitary mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RemoveMilitary).

Formerly known as Peaceful Tweak - Bob's Equipment
